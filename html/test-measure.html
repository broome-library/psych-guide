<p>Tests and Measurements are standardized instruments, such as questionnaires, inventories and scales, which are used to measure constructs in various social science disciplines. They are used for diagnosis, research or assessment.</p>
<h4 id="helpful-hints">Helpful Hints:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Finding specific tests and measurements can be challenging. In some cases, you will find only a description or review of the test and not the test itself.</li>
<li>Not all tests are readily available. In order to obtain and administer many <strong>published</strong> psychological tests (commercial tests), one must be a licensed professional or meet certain criteria; also, many published tests are only available through purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Non-published</strong> or non-commercial tests may be obtained more easily. They can appear in books, journal articles, or in other sources. Identifying and locating them may take some time and patience.</li>
<li>In brief, there is no quick, easy, one-stop shop, guaranteed way of finding tests and measures. Finding them requires looking in several different print and/or electronic sources.</li>
